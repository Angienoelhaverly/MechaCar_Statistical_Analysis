# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
Statistics is an essential component to data science because it helps analysts contextualize data and facilitates making informative decisions. 
R is a programming that helps with statistical analysis. 

Statistical analysis can be especially helpful when companies are evaluating product design and improvement. In this project, AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
*### Hypotheses
* Null Hypothesis (H0): The slope of the linear model is zero.
*Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The slope of the linear model is not zero.
*### Results*

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
