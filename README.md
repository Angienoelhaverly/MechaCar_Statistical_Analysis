# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Project Overview
Statistics is an essential component to data science because it helps analysts contextualize data and facilitates making informative decisions. 
R is a programming that helps with statistical analysis. 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
